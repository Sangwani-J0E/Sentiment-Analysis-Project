# Sentiment Analysis System

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis System**, a Python-powered application that evaluates the sentiment of user-provided text. This project analyzes comments, phrases, or tweets and provides a detailed sentiment breakdown, making it easier to understand the tone and context of user input.

This project was developed for a **client** and demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for sentiment evaluation. 

---

## Project Overview

The Sentiment Analysis System processes user input to determine whether the sentiment is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. It also provides additional metrics like **polarity** and **subjectivity** to give deeper insights into the text's sentiment.

---

## Features

1. **Sentiment Classification**:
   - Identifies sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral with corresponding visual indicators.

2. **Detailed Metrics**:
   - Calculates **polarity** (tone) and **subjectivity** (degree of opinion).

3. **Interactive Interface**:
   - Input phrases, tweets, or comments for analysis.
   - Supports multiple languages for diverse user needs.

4. **Recent Searches**:
   - Saves recent analyses for quick review.
   - Download recent searches as a CSV file.

5. **Visualizations**:
   - Generates bar charts to visualize polarity and subjectivity metrics.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **Streamlit**: For building the web-based interactive interface.
  - **TextBlob**: For NLP-based sentiment analysis.
  - **Plotly**: For creating dynamic visualizations.
  - **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Pillow**: For handling images.
  - **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks like lemmatization and stopword removal.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced NLP Models**:
   - Integrate more advanced libraries like **spaCy** or **transformers** for improved sentiment analysis.

2. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Extend support for additional languages and implement translations for analysis results.

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Allow bulk input for simultaneous analysis of multiple comments or tweets.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the system to a cloud platform for online access.
